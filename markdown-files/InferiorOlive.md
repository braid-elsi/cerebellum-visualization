# Inferior Olive

The Inferior Olive is a structure in the brainstem, located in the medulla oblongata, that plays a critical role in cerebellar function. Humans have two inferior olives, one on each side of the medulla .The inferior olive neurons are highly responsive to **unexpected events** or errors in timing, coordination, or movement accuracy. For example, if you try to catch a ball and miss, the sensory feedback (ball not in hand) will trigger error-related signals in the inferior olive.

* The inferior olive is the sole source of climbing fibers that project to the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex.
* It is heavily involved in:
    * **Motor learning**: The inferior olive helps the cerebellum adapt and refine motor actions.
    * **Error correction**: It sends "teaching signals" that encode errors in movement and helps update motor plans.
    * **Timing and coordination**: It is thought to contribute to the precise timing required for motor and cognitive tasks.
* The inferior olive compares the predicted outcome (from the DCN) with actual sensory feedback (received from sensory pathways like the spinal cord or brainstem). If thereâ€™s a discrepancy between the two signals, the olive generates error signals, which are sent back to the cerebellum via climbing fibers to update the forward model and improve future predictions.
* The activity of the inferior olive is thought to be synchronized by "gap junctions" (electrical synapses) between its neurons. This synchronization is crucial for the timing of climbing fiber signals, which influence motor learning and error correction in the cerebellum.
