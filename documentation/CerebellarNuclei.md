# Deep Cerebellar Nuclei

Whereas granule cells amplify and process input, deep cerebellar nuclei neurons condense and transmit output to orchestrate motor and cognitive functions. The DCN neurons are the primary output structures of the cerebellum: they integrate processed information from Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and send output signals to other brain regions for motor execution and coordination. Other facts:

* It is estimated that there are 1.5 million DCN neurons in the brain. 
* The ratio between granule cells and DCN neurons is 50,000 : 1. This high ratio demonstrates the cerebellumâ€™s expansion and compression model: an enormous amount of sensory and motor information is expanded in the input layer (granule cells) and ultimately condensed into a smaller number of output signals (via DCN neurons).
* A single DCN neuron receives input from thousands of Purkinje cells.
* The Deep Cerebellar Nuclei is also responsible for generating a predicted output based on efference copies (with input from Purkinje cells) that the inferior olive uses as an input to detect errors vis a vis sensory input signals.
