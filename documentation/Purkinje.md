# Purkinje Cells
Cerebellar Purkinje cells are **inhibitory neurons**, meaning that in their presynaptic role, they inhibit the activity of their target neurons (by releasing the neurotransmitter GABA). 

## Inputs
Purkinje cells ***receive excitatory input*** from two main sources: 
* **Climbing fibers** (from the inferior olive) → form powerful, one-to-one synapses.
* **Parallel fibers** (from granule cells) → form weaker, many-to-one synapses. 

These excitatory inputs influence the firing patterns of the Purkinje cells. 

## Outputs
However, Purkinje cells ***send inhibitory output*** to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). They release the GABA neurotransmitter, which inhibits the DCN neurons and modulates motor output. 

Summary Postsynaptic Role: Receives excitatory input from climbing and parallel fibers.
Presynaptic Role: Sends inhibitory output to the deep cerebellar
nuclei. Thus, Purkinje cells are excitatory in their inputs but
inhibitory in their outputs.
