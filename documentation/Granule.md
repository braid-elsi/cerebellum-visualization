# Granule Cells

It is estimated that there are between 50–100 billion granule cells in the human brain (more than half of all cells in the human brain).

## Summary

Mossy fibers synapse onto a large number of **granule cells** in order to perform “pattern separation” and sparse coding. Each granule cell integrates signals from multiple mossy fibers, resulting in a combinatorial expansion of input signals into a much higher-dimensional space. This “expansion coding” amplifies small differences in input patterns, making them easier for downstream neurons (like Purkinje cells) to distinguish between different sensory patterns. Because only a small fraction of granule cells activate for any given input pattern, this “sparse coding” reduces overlap between similar inputs, making the resulting patterns more distinct.

For instance, say you were hiking in the woods. For one step of your hike, you step on a flat rock. Later, you step on a small pebble. Even though both steps share similar sensory inputs (the trees and plants around you, the view of the trail ahead, the feel of the breeze on your skin, etc., MF-to-GrC connections allow the brain to detect small differences in sensory input by creating unique activity patterns across the granule cells. In this way, the distinction between stepping on the pebble and the flat rock can be amplified, while minimizing redundant signals and reducing noise in the signals. Hence, these patterns provide the raw material for detecting differences or anomalies.

## Quantities
* Each cerebellar granule cell typically receives input from about 4 mossy fiber inputs and extends parallel fibers that form synapses with the dendrites of **thousands of Purkinje cells**.
* On average, a single cerebellar granule cell makes around 200,000 synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites (question: ~100 synapses for a single purkinje cell?).
* It is estimated that there are between 50–100 billion granule cells in the human brain (more than half of all cells in the human brain).
