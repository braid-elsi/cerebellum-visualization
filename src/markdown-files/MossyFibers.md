# Mossy Fibers
Mossy fibers carry two types of signals from the brainstem into the cerebellum:
1. Copies of motor commands that have been issued to the muscles, known as efference copies, and
2. Sensory / contextual signals that represent what is actually happening in the world.

Mossy fibers synapse onto a large number of **granule cells** in order to perform "pattern separation" and sparse coding.
