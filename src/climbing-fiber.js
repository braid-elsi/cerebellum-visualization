/**
 * Each Purkinje cell receives input from a single climbing fiber,
 * but each climbing fiber can branch and innervate 1â€“10 Purkinje cells.
 *
 * A climbing fiber generates a complex spike in the Purkinje cell,
 * characterized by a large, prolonged depolarization and burst of action potentials.
 * This complex spike is distinct from the simple spikes generated by parallel
 * fibers and provides a unique signal for the Purkinje cell to interpret.
 *
 * Climbing fibers play a role in timing and synchronization of cerebellar activity.
 * The activity of climbing fibers from the inferior olive is thought to be
 * synchronized, providing temporal precision that helps coordinate the
 * firing of Purkinje cells and downstream motor output.
